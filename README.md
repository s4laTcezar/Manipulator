This program will render a kinematic model of manipulator and his workspace according to your specified parameters

Your input parameters will be the arm angles of the manipulator.
phi1 - Rotation of the first shoulder around the Z Axis;
phi2 - Rotation of the second shoulder around the Y Axis;
phi3 - Rotation of the third shoulder around the Y Axis;

The second part of this program is workspace.
You will able to set values on your own: 
<phi1_min; phi1_max>
<phi2_min; phi2_max>
<phi3_min; phi3_max>

After entering these values, you will be rendered the manipulator and its working area according to the parameters you set.

There is a .jar file that you can launch using this command in Command Prompt:
java -jar Manipulator-1.jar
